<p><i> How Europe Underdeveloped Africa </i> is the seminal work of Dr
Walter Rodney, Guyanese political thinker and activist. Dr Rodney
attempts to reframe the long-echoed notion of European colonialism being
an “unfortunate but ultimately mutually-beneficial endeavor,” and he
does so quite successfully. In my opinion, although the whole of this
work is exemplary and worth learning from, its most important
contribution to the understanding of imperialism and colonialism occurs
within the very first chapter.</p>
<p>The book opens with a discussion on the concept of development
itself. Development and underdevelopment, Dr Rodney argues, in the
imperialist and colonial contexts are interlinked.</p>
<p>To start off, what is development? Development at an individual level
can be described as an increase in skill and well-being. Personal
developmental processes such as maturity, growth, evolution, et cetera,
can all be seen to fit this definition. However, we cannot examine
personal development without understanding the state of the society the
individual is located in. Development is not an indivual process.
Development is the improvement of the capacity of social groups and
their ability to regulate their internal and external environment, regardless of the will of
individuals.</p>
<p>The economy can be seen as a measure of a society’s development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A society develops economically as its members increase jointly their
capacity for dealing with the environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This capacity is dependent on a few key factors: their scientific
understanding, the extent to which they use and devise tools, and their
organization of social work. Dr Rodney states that “every people have
shown a capacity for independently increasing their ability to live a
more satisfactory life through exploiting the resources of nature.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increase in the quantity of goods produced leads to increase in
quality or character of society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr Rodney demonstrates the above rule through the example of China,
where the originally family-based units transformed into a semi-feudal
society as the ability to create specialist goods increased.</p>
<p>Changes in the economy lead to changes in societal organization which
in turns impacts economic development.</p>
<p>Dr Rodney briefly points out that economic development is not akin to
moral development. Economic development is merely a change in societal
organization and understanding. The European transition from communalism
to slavery cannot be said to be a moral development, however it was
undeniably an economic development (as societal organization had reached
a new stage).</p>
<p>In my opinion, this point is very important, especially in the
current imperialist world order, given how more economically developed
countries portray themselves as morally superior in order to justify
their actions (i.e. “humanitarian” interventions led by imperialist
militaries that occupy and exploit foreign land).</p>
<p>Continuing, there are points in time where a certain stage of social
organization can become obsolete or counter-productive, and thus oppose
societal development.</p>
<p>Uneven development, or the different rates at which different
societies develop, is an important characteristic of understanding
history. There are various reasons for uneven development, most notably
the exploitability of the land occupied by a society, but ideological
factors are not to be ignored. For example, the superstitions and
beliefs of Europe during the Dark Ages inhibited and suppressed
scientific and economic development. During this same period, the
African and Arabian countries were experiencing tremendously scientific
advancement.</p>
<p>The current capitalist world-order is one directly derived from
slavery and colonialism, and thus the development of European capitalism
cannot be properly examined without this perspective. European
development cannot be explained without African underdevelopment.</p>
<p>Then, what is underdevelopment? Underdevelopment is not a lack of
development. All societies have developed. Underdevelopment is a
comparative measure; one society is said to be less economically
developed than another. Certain societies at certain times can be said
to be more advanced in their production and more wealthy, and thus more
economically developed (i.e. uneven development). This is the first
characteristic of underdevelopment.</p>
<p>The second characteristic of underdevelopment is exploitation. The
independent development of Africa was interrupted by European via
imperialism and colonialism, leading to Africa’s exploitation. The
Africans’ wealth, both in the form of riches and labor (surplus value),
had been exported by way of gunpowder.</p>
<p>The exploitation of labor is a point that should not be overlooked.
The exploitation of labor is the prime factor as to how Africa was
underdeveloped.</p>
<p>Although the African continent had a lot of production, the products
and the profits from those products were exported, denying Africans the
fruits of their labor. Instead of having ownerships over one’s products
of labor, the products were taken away into Europe where the Europeans
could enjoy the cheap prices. If Africans wanted to access their own
products, they could only do so when the Europeans imported the products
back from Europe at outrageous prices, effectively preventing the
African from having African products.</p>
<p>To understand underdevelopment, we must first look at how developed
countries function.</p>
<p>There are 5 key qualitative sectors that maintain and eventually
improve a country. First, there is the food production sector. A healthy
production of food leads to healthy workers, and healthy workers bring a
healthy supply of labor, and thus (in the capitalist context) a surplus
in the form of profits. These profits and laborers are then funneled
into the industrial sector, where steel and electricity are produced.
Steel and electricity provides ample resources for the creation of
industrial machines. Industrial machines are then used to create
machinery for agriculture. This agricultual machinery improves the food
production sector, and so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>It is then clear to see why, for example, socialist countries such as
the USSR, Cuba, China, and Vietnam, were initially so diligently focused
on improving the food production process. The nationalization of
farmland via the Agrarian Reform Act in Cuba was the first action that
was taken after Castro’s revolution overthrew Batista. In the USSR,
China, and Vietnam, the collectivization of agriculture was a primary
focus after their revolutions. This collectivization is what fueled the
subsequent stages of developing industry.</p>
<p>For underdeveloped countries, this very first step of creating an
effective and efficient food production sector is denied to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is typical of underdeveloped countries that they do not (or are
not allowed to) concentrate on those sectors of the economy which in
turn will generate growth and raise production to a new level together,
and there are very few ties between one sector and another so that (say)
agriculture and industry could react beneficially on each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point of underdeveloped countries not being allowed to
concentrate on these sectors deserves more attention. It is well-known
that Africa was used for large-scale production of cash crops during the
colonial period. The whole African infrastructure, designed and
maintained by the colonialists, served a single function: take the cash
crops from their places of production, transport the products to the
ports, and send everything away to Europe. The Europeans were not
interested in tying agriculture to industry, as if they had been
interested then the African economy would have positively improved
(i.e. been developed).</p>
<p>This is only one of the characteristics of underdeveloped countries.
Other characteristings include: 
<ul>
<li>- Economic savings are not spent on
production but on consumption </li>
<li> - There is a heavy focus on paying for
auxiliary services (civil servants, politicians, the military, et
cetera) </li> 
<li> - Disproportionate wealth goes into a priviledged few (the
auxiliary servies above mentioned) via taxes. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Now, it is important to not take these characteristics without the
context in which they are present. It is easy to say, for example, that
if economic savings were to be spent on production and subsequent
imports, then the current state of Africa could erase the echoes of
colonization and reach its potential. However, things are not this
simple. The relationship of exploitation is far more complex than it may
appear, and mere quantities of imports and exports does not tell the
whole story. For if imports were reduced and exports were increased, the
terms of trade (in the current state of things) serve to benefit the
Imperial Core, via unequal exchange and dollar hegemony. These are
topics I will discuss at another time in some other post, but for now it
is enough to note that the above mentioned characteristics do not tell
the whole story.</p>
<p>Continuing the discussion of underdevelopment, we must look at where
Africa finds itself in the capitalist markets. Africa indeed does find
itself placed firmly within the capitalist system, via relations of
trade, capitalist investment, and colonial/neo-colonial domination. Its
participation can explain its underdevelopment, as the wealth of Africa
(both its labor and resources) are lost to Western capitalist countries
and thus has been restricted in its development. To refer to Rodney’s
phrasing, it has “not been allowed” to reach its potential. Africa’s
integration into the global capitalist structure ensures its dependency
on Western capital and thus stagnates its development.</p>
<p>This structural dependency is essential to keep Africa
underdeveloped, as Africa (and the Imperial Periphery as a whole)
provides cheap labor and raw materials to the Imperial Core, and in
return the Core returns to Africa high profit consumption goods. It can
be seen, then, how the development of the Core is dependent on the
exploitation of the Periphery (but the core controls the relationship),
and how the underdevelopment of the Periphery is dependent on its
exploitation by the Core.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of cultural imperialism, wherein ties to the
capitalist system are maintained via culture and social values. Although
it is an important matter, it will be discussed at another time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it should be clear that the imperialist and
colonialist system is what has resulted in Africa’s underdevelopment. In
order for underdeveloped nations to properly develop, they must break
the chains of imperialism that their economies are trapped in. These
nations, to borrow a phrase from Samir Amin, must “delink” themselves
and form their own networks of economic relations, networks that are not
dependent on the Western capitalist powers.</p>

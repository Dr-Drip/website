title: Top 9 Songs About 9/11

9/11 was a historically significant event for many reasons, not least because of its influence on the world of music.
From inspiring the creation of bands such as My Chemical Romance to being referenced off-handedly by Eminem, there is no doubt that 9/11 has done a lot for music.
In honor of all that the collapse of the World Trade Center has done, I will be counting down the top 9 songs that are about or reference the 2001 attack.

## 9. Merchant Ships: Sleep Patterns ##

Sleep Patterns is one of those songs that you don't want to listen to often. 
Sleep Patterns is a song that you skip when it comes on shuffle.
Sleep Patterns is not enjoyable to listen to.

But, Sleep Patterns is a great song.

The almost-fully spoken word song tells the story of a narrator who experiences dreams wherein he's singing with strangers in a car that eventually crashes and leads to his death. The narrator soon meets the strangers he saw in the dream and befriends them, which plants a seed of fear that the events he envisioned would come true.

The narrator speaks to his brother, trying to shield him from a nihilistic, pessimistic perspective that the narrator has developed throughout life. The narrator tries to protect his brother from the pain that comes with death. 

But these efforts are in vain, because reality must be faced at some point.

## 8. Bloc Party: Hunting for Witches ##

For a song about the death of 3,000 people, it starts off with a pretty sick riff.
If you're not paying attention to the lyrics, you can totally groove out to this without any clue of what happened on September 11, 2001.

"Hunting for Witches" details the progression of an optimistic teenager who, now living in a world of enemies set on wreaking terror to all those around them, begins taking action by 'hunting witches' with the aid of a shotgun.

This is, of course, not a well thought-out response to the situation. Blind vigilantism will get you nowhere. Perhaps Bloc Party should take their own advice and realize that "now is not the time for liberal thought."

Overall, the song reeks of Br\*tish priviledge, but there's a really cool breakdown before the bridge so it's not bad.

## 7. My Chemical Romance: Skylines and Turnstiles ##

Thank you Gerard Way for writing this song and starting My Chemical Romance.

I don't have much else to say about this song. The lyrics are alright; there are some interesting descriptions of and references to the 9/11 attacks. The instrumentation is identifiably MCR despite it being one of their earliest songs. You get a glimpse of the potential heights the band would reach in their future, but I definitely prefer songs from the proceeding albums.

## 6. Smash Mouth: Out of Sight ##

Although this is a very heartfelt and emotional song meant to invoke hope for the victims of the attacks, the association I have of the singer's voice to Shrek makes it very difficult to not take this song as a joke.

I want to give myself some credit though and say that there are definitely some almost-comical lyrics that are very out of place for a memorial song. For example: "the concierge can't tell us where the ladies dance, but you are my friend in miles." I can't be the only one confused by this.

Despite everything though, I understand how this can be an inspiring song to listen to. It's not as annoying as the average Smash Mouth song at the very least.

## 5. Eminem: My Dad's Gone Crazy ##

Eminem. Marshall Mathers. The Real Slim Shady. Em. 

One of the greatest MCs of all time, Eminem is known for his intricate multi-syllabic internal rhymes paired with violent lyricism mixed with a sense of dark comedy that is not found anywhere else. Truly, he knows no bounds when it comes to rapping. 

But maybe he should! Because on "My Dad's Gone Crazy", Eminem follows up a name-dropping of R. Kelly with the line "more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade." Incredible.

Rhymes like this beg the question that perhaps the events of 20 year ago were maybe worth it? 

Not at all, but at least we know that everything, including 9/11, has a silver-lining.

## 4. Daft Punk: Get Lucky ##

Need I say more? No.

But I will.

Although an unlikely candidate for the list, "Get Lucky" is a subtly insidious song that finds joy in the face of undesirable circumstances.

This is apparent from the get-go when Pharrell sings "all ends with beginnings," referring to the start of the War on Terror that began right after the end of the World Trade Center. 

The references to the attacks continue in the next line with "what keeps the planet spinning." This is a subtle allusion to the conspiracy theory that the air travel industry, and especially pilots, are aware of the world being flat but keep the truth hidden from the public, motivated by a desire for control. One would not think of this instantly, but it is safe to assume that the hijackers, once they had taken control over the planes that flew into the Towers, would also eventually come to know about the world being flat.

Although there are no more <i> direct </i> references to 9/11, the main hook of the song ("We're up all night to get lucky") and its variations are used 99 times in the song. 99 is, of course, 9 times 11.

## 3. Childish Gambino ##

Within a single bar ("this beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track"), Childish Gambino reminds us that it's okay to use tragedies as punchlines as long as they are funny.

## 2. Immortal Technique:  ##

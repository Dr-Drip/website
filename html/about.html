		This website serves as a personal outlet to share my thoughts on various subjects. 
		<br><br>	
		The opinions shared on this website are not infallible, nor are they rigid.
		They are likely to change as I go through life, and indeed I hope they do change.
		<br><br>
		This project is my way to analyze the world around me in hopes to carve a path that allows it to be improved.
		<br><br>
		Also, I hope to have some fun.
